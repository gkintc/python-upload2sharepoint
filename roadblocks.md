Error from Office 365:', 'AADSTS53003: Access has been blocked by Conditional Access policies. The access policy does not allow token issuance.

- Need to contact the sharepoint admin or O365 admin to grant me access so that I will not be blocked by Conditional Access policies to issue token.This needs to be done for the sharepoint_test-user as well.

- Also get a sharepoint_test-user account with permissions just enough to create a sharepoint site and have full access to the site to be able to upload files/folders.
